# 3DOF-Human-Arm-Model
The 3 degree of freedom human arm mathematical model

This model is coded in MATLAB and its equations are obtained by Euler-Lagrange method.

The human arm can is simulated as three links, where the upper arm is the first link that is jointed with elbow. 
The lower part of the arm is connected to the wrist. The third part of the arm is the palm. 
For simplification's sake, the rotation angle from a vertical position of the three human arm parts are denoted
as Theta 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

This repo contains euler-lagrange dynamics which has been obtained by hand, but the answers are crosschecked with
the answer of mathematica. The mathematica notebooks are also present in the repo.
